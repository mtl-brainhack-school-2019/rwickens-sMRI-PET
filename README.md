# Structural MRI  

PROJECT 1:  

- Make sense of my lab's PET pipeline. Currently, the document is confusing and has hindered my ability to grasp the steps.
- Follow these steps and successfully pre-process my laboratory's sMRI and PET (FDG/NAV tracer) data
  - To achieve this, I need to become comfortable working with CBRAIN and CIVET
- Generate statistical t-maps of PET data
- If time allows, improve the document explaining the pipeline 
- If time allows, attempt using MAGeT brain

Deliverable: a Jupyter notebook with detailed steps - an improvement of the instructions file that I received. 

PROJECT 2: 

- Download PREVENT-AD and OASIS datasets
- Pre-process MRI files to make them analysis-ready
- Feature extraction
- Dimensionality reduction
- Machine learning with Nilearn 
- Type of analysis to be determined

Information about my lab's data: 

- Alzheimerâ€™s disease (n = 12; 6 AD and 6 controls). 1.5T scanner. 
- Parkinson's disease (n = 18; 6 PD - cognitively normal, 6 PD - executive dysfunction, 6 controls). 3T scanner. 
- Idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder (n = 10; 5 with RBD and 5 controls). 3T scanner. 
 
I also have the following participant data:

- Demographic variables for all subjects (e.g., age, education)
- For the Alzheimer's study - NAV- and FDG-PET data
- For the REM sleep behaviour disorder: 
    - Clinical data: UPDRS scale, medical info, odour tests, hue tests, MoCA, and others
    - Movement-related data: Timed-up-and-go, purdue pegboard
    - Polysomnography data: sleep architecture, %EMG (phasic and tonic) during REM sleep
- For the Parkinson's study: UPDRS scale, autonomic function, Levodopa dose, disease duration, incomplete neuropsychological testing.

My intention was to create a machine learning classifier that accurately classifies diagnosis (Alzheimer's, REM sleep behaviour disorder, Parkinson's, or healthy control) based on image features and clinical variables from my lab's dataset. However, Jake has informed me (2019-08-13) that this is not advisable due to sample size.
