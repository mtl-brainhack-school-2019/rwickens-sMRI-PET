# Structural MRI  

PROJECT 1:  

- Make sense of my lab's PET pipeline. Currently, the document is confusing and has hindered my ability to grasp the steps.
- Follow these steps and successfully pre-process my laboratory's sMRI and PET (FDG/NAV tracer) data
  - To achieve this, I need to become comfortable working with CBRAIN and CIVET
-	Run this same data thru Freesurfer and Dartel and/or ANTS
  - This will expose me to an alternative of CIVET
- (If time allows, run data through MAGeT brain)

Deliverable: a Jupyter notebook that improves the instruction sheet that I was given. Includes shell commands. Briefly explains the rationale behind the order of steps.  

PROJECT 2: 

- Download PREVENT-AD and OASIS datasets
- Feature extraction (use of python, numpy and pandas) 
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Machine learning with Nilearn 
- Type of analysis to be determined

Deliverable: a Jupyter notebook that shows each of the above steps.

Information about my lab's data: 

- Alzheimerâ€™s disease (n = 12; 6 AD and 6 controls). 1.5T scanner. 
- Parkinson's disease (n = 18; 6 PD - cognitively normal, 6 PD - executive dysfunction, 6 controls). 3T scanner. 
- Idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder (n = 10; 5 with RBD and 5 controls). 3T scanner. 
 
I also have the following participant data:

- Demographic variables for all subjects (e.g., age, education)
- For the Alzheimer's study - NAV- and FDG-PET data
- For the REM sleep behaviour disorder: 
    - Clinical data: UPDRS scale, medical info, odour tests, hue tests, MoCA, and others
    - Movement-related data: Timed-up-and-go, purdue pegboard
    - Polysomnography data: sleep architecture, %EMG (phasic and tonic) during REM sleep
- For the Parkinson's study: UPDRS scale, autonomic function, Levodopa dose, disease duration, incomplete neuropsychological testing.

My intention was to create a machine learning classifier that accurately classifies diagnosis (Alzheimer's, REM sleep behaviour disorder, Parkinson's, or healthy control) based on image features and clinical variables from my lab's dataset. However, Jake has informed me (2019-08-13) that this is not advisable due to sample size.
